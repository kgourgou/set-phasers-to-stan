# Homework -- STAN 

So, here's what I have as an idea for a homework. 

1) Run the Euler-Maruyama from previous homework. Use one path as data. 
2) Edit files to fit a linear model and a quadratic model through the data with sigma fixed. Try to pick your own sigma. 

3) Now run the same but let stan figure out sigma. 
4) Compare the fits and how good you did in picking the sigma.
